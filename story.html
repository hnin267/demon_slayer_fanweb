      <h2>Kimetsu no Yaiba (Anime)</h2>

      </p>
      <div class="line mb-3"></div>
      <h3>Plot</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="highlight">
          <a href="index.html">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</a></span
        >
        is set in a dark world where demons hide in the shadows and attack
        humans at night. To protect innocent people, an organization called the
        Demon Slayer Corps exists to hunt and destroy these demons. Villages
        live in constant fear, relying on skilled swordsmen to keep them safe.
        This dangerous setting creates the foundation for the intense battles
        and emotional story of the anime. 🌙⚔️
      </p>
      <p>
        The main conflict of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba begins when Tanjiro
        Kamado’s family is brutally killed by demons. His younger sister Nezuko
        survives but is turned into a demon, creating a painful struggle between
        love and loss. Determined to protect her, Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer
        Corps to fight demons and search for a cure. This powerful conflict
        drives the story forward and shapes Tanjiro’s journey. 💔⚔️
      </p>
      <p>
        The main conflict deepens as Tanjiro realizes that demons are not only
        powerful but also once human. While fighting to protect innocent people,
        he struggles with the pain of killing creatures that were once like him.
        At the same time, Nezuko must fight her demon instincts to protect
        humans, showing that hope still exists. This emotional battle between
        duty, compassion, and survival makes the conflict even more intense.
        🌑❤️⚔️
      </p>
      <div class="line mb-3"></div>
      <h3>His journey</h3>
      <p>
        Tanjiro’s journey begins with intense training to become a member of the
        Demon Slayer Corps. He learns sword techniques,<span class="highlight"
          ><a href="breathing_styles.html"> breathing styles</a></span
        >, and how to face fear in life-and-death battles. Each fight tests his
        strength, endurance, and kindness toward others. Through hardship and
        pain, Tanjiro slowly grows into a skilled and disciplined warrior.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the journey continues, Tanjiro meets powerful allies and dangerous
        enemies that shape his path. He learns important lessons about
        responsibility, sacrifice, and understanding others’ suffering. Every
        battle pushes him closer to his goal of saving Nezuko and defeating the
        demons. His growth shows that true strength comes from perseverance and
        compassion. 🌸⚔️
      </p>
      <div class="line mb-3"></div>
      <h3>Themes & Message</h3>
      <p>
        One of the strongest themes in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba is the
        bond of family. Tanjiro’s love for Nezuko gives him the strength to
        continue fighting, even when he is exhausted or injured. The story shows
        how family can be a source of hope and motivation during the darkest
        times. This emotional connection makes the characters’ struggles feel
        real and heartfelt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important theme is the balance between kindness and duty. Demon
        slayers must destroy demons to protect humans, yet Tanjiro often shows
        compassion toward his enemies, understanding their past suffering. The
        anime highlights sacrifice, responsibility, and the courage to do what
        is right. These themes give the story deeper meaning beyond its action
        and battles. ❤️⚔️
      </p>

      <h3>Origin of Demons</h3>
      <p>
        Demons are once-human beings who have fallen into darkness after being
        corrupted by demonic blood. They possess supernatural strength, rapid
        regeneration, and an insatiable hunger for human flesh. Most demons are
        created under the influence of Muzan Kibutsuji, the first and most
        powerful demon. While demons gain immortality and power, they lose their
        humanity, memories, and emotions, becoming creatures driven by fear,
        rage, and hunger. Sunlight and Nichirin blades remain their greatest
        weaknesses.
      </p>
      <div class="line mb-3"></div>
      <h3>Demon Slayers Crops</h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>Demon Slayer Corps</strong> is an ancient organization
        formed to protect humanity from demons. Though unrecognized by the
        government, its members risk their lives every night to keep people
        safe. Demon slayers undergo harsh training and wield special Nichirin
        blades, weapons forged to kill demons. By mastering powerful
        <span class="highlight"
          ><a href="breathing_styles.html">Breathing Styles</a></span
        >, they enhance their strength, speed, and senses, allowing them to
        stand against creatures far stronger than ordinary humans.⚔️⚔️
